NVIDIA CUDA Particle Simulation V1.2

--------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this program is to simulate various polimers and 
some solids with the help of the NVIDIA GPU. Existing programs
including the program this replaces was run on a multi-core cpu
and took about a week to finish. With the aid of the gpu, this 
problem can be completed in real time.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Installation:

This program requires an NVIDIA CUDA capable GPU with compute 
cabability of 3.0 or higher. NVIDIA CUDA sdk and Microsoft Visual 
Studio 2008 and later are used in the development process.

Refer to NVIDIA CUDA sdk and Visual studio installation.

How to use the program:

Refer to the quickstart guide to find out how to modify the program 
and the particleinit file to add objects to the simulation.
